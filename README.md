This repo contains all of the code used for Sandbag, but **please note that no sprite content is included** at this time as the character has been created using official Super Smash Flash 2 sprites, which developers have requested to not be reuploaded. If the art is replaced at some point with custom art, expect it to be uploaded to this repo.

------

Sprites and most source material created by the Super Smash Flash 2 developers, namely (AFAIK) FriendAlias and ZeroInsanity for art, and myself for most code and moveset design.

Programmed in Haxe. 
From Seattle with love.
